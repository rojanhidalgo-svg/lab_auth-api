During this lab, I faced several errors, such as invalid JSON input in Postman, missing .env variables that caused the secretOrPrivateKey must have a value error, and Cannot GET /api/auth/profile because routes were not mounted correctly. 
Another issue was forgetting to import the middleware properly, which caused crashes in the server. Through debugging, I learned the importance of carefully checking imports, mounting routes, and using environment variables securely. 
Overall, this activity taught me how JWT authentication works, how bcrypt secures passwords, and how middleware acts as a gatekeeper in Express.
